""" Get the "closest" git version to a given version on a given repository.

If the version is semantic formatted as <major>.<minor>.<patch> e.g. 4.0.1,
this will print a version with the same major version, and with a minor version
either the same or greater than the given minor version.  If a version with
the same patch version exists, this will be printed, otherwise a greater
patch number if possible, but if not, the greatest patch number is used.
If the same major version does not exist, or only minor versions less than
the minor version exist, master is printed.

If a non-semantic version is given, if a branch or tag exists with the version,
this is printed, otherwise master is printed.

If a third argument is given, this is taken as a version prefix to be used;
any semantic version will be assumed to have this prefix.
